Welcome to the "Near-Term Quantum Spin Simulation of the Spin-1/2 Square $J_{1}-J_{2}$ Heisenberg Model" GitHub repository!

In this repository the following algorithms are implemented:
  - Quantum Computed Moments
  - Fast & Efficient Lanczos Method using LCU
  - Fast & Efficient Lanczos Method using VFF
  - Basic VQE
  - Theoretical Krylov Implementations using Real-Time basis and Lanczos basis

The goal of the repository is to help reproduction efforts and to give base code where base code might not already exist for other projects.
